# ![Lucca](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gueorgui/lucca/master/images/lucca.png) Lucca: a modular CLI time tracker

Lucca is a time tracker intended for people working on multiple projects and
interested in tracking the time spent on each.

Lucca is derived from my own freelance work as a developer. It is a work in progress, the planned features are:

- [ ] CLI for starting/stopping time tracking
- [ ] Interactive note taking for the currently tracked task
- [ ] Comprehensive statistics per day, week, month, year
- [ ] Export of statistics to multiple formats (with plugin support)
- [ ] Support of billable/non-billable tasks
- [ ] Per-project configuration files
- [ ] Etc.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lucca'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lucca

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
